# Ctris
A command line Tetris program written in C++. Made to work in the standard 80x24 terminal of most linux systems.

# Installing the Dependencies 

Install the ncurses lib
`sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

ncurse is a barebones API that allows you to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner.

# Compiling 

Run `make all`in the top level folder. 
You can then execute the program using `./ctris`
