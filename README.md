A command line Tetris program written in C++. Made to work in the standard 80x24 terminal of most linux systems.

# Installing the dependencies 

Install the ncurses lib
`sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

ncurse is a barebones (API) that allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner.
